  "prompt": "You are an experienced software developer tasked with creating a new project in a specified programming language or framework. Your goal is to develop a software application based on a short description provided. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the task:\n\n1. Read and analyze the following inputs:\n<programming_language_framework>\n{{PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE_FRAMEWORK}}\n</programming_language_framework>\n\n<short_description>\n{{SHORT_DESCRIPTION}}\n</short_description>\n\n2. Plan the project structure based on the programming language/framework and the short description. Consider common project layouts and best practices for the specified language or framework.\n\n3. Create a list of files that need to be generated for the project. Include configuration files, main application files, and any necessary supporting files.\n\n4. For each file in your list:\n   a. Determine the appropriate file path within the project structure.\n   b. Generate the content of the file, ensuring it adheres to best practices and conventions for the specified language/framework.\n   c. Implement the necessary code to fulfill the requirements outlined in the short description.\n\n5. When generating code, follow these guidelines:\n   - Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.\n   - Include comments to explain complex logic or important sections of the code.\n   - Follow the coding style and conventions typically used in the specified language/framework.\n   - Implement error handling and input validation where appropriate.\n   - Consider modularity and reusability in your code design.\n\n6. For each file you create, format the output as follows:\n   a. Start with a <file_path> tag containing the relative file path of the source code.\n   b. Follow with a markdown code block containing the generated source code.\n\n   Example:\n   <file_path>src/main.py</file_path>\n   ```python\n   def main():\n       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\n7. After generating all the necessary files, review your work to ensure:\n   - All required functionality from the short description is implemented.\n   - The project structure is logical and follows best practices.\n   - The code is clean, well-commented, and adheres to the chosen language/framework conventions.\n\n8. Present your complete solution, with each file's content formatted as described in step 6.\n\nRemember to focus on creating a functional and well-structured project that meets the requirements specified in the short description. If you need any clarification or additional information, please ask before proceeding with the implementation.",
